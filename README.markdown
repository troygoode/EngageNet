The [RPX OpenID](http://rpxnow.com/) authentication service is a public API to simplify the integration of single sign on into a public website. This project is a wrapper library written in C# .Net 3.5. It intends to make integration with RPX trivial and rapid.

Included is a sample ASP.Net MVC sample web site to demonstrate the integration points with the library.

# Please help

If you use this library (or more importantly, you want to but it fails) please send some feedback through to me so that I can upgrade the library. So far I am the only consumer of the library, and it hasn't been that thouroughly tested in the real world. It works for me and I find RPX a great service to interact with, so it would be great if this library could grow to help RPX integration for the .Net community.
